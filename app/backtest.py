"""Simple walk-forward backtest for a (possibly compound) alert rule.

Not a full backtesting engine — just answers "how many times would this
rule have fired over this history, and what happened N bars afterward on
average?". Reuses the exact same evaluate_conditions() used live, so the
backtest result matches real behavior by construction.
